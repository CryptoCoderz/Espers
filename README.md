Espers [ESP] is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Assistance and Contact
--------------------
We strive to be an open and friendly community that is eager to help each other through 
the journey of the Espers [ESP] project development. If at any time someone needs assistance
or just a community member to talk to, please feel free to join our Discord at https://discord.gg/cn3AfPS

Development Process
-------------------
The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/CryptoCoderz/Espers/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Espers [ESP].

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer Discord should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes 
before working on a patch set.

Developer Discord can be found at https://discord.gg/cn3AfPS .

Testing
-------
Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
